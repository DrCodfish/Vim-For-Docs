## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for new features:

- **Search Existing Issues:** Before opening a new issue, please check the [issues list](https://github.com/greenstorm5417/Vim-For-Docs/issues) to see if your concern has already been reported.
- **Create a New Issue:** When opening a new issue, please include as much detail as possible:
  - A clear description of the problem or suggestion.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.
  - Expected and actual behavior.
  - Screenshots or logs (if applicable).

## Submitting Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, new features, or improvements to documentation. Please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create a personal fork on GitHub.
2. **Create a Branch:** Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `fix/mode-indicator-bug` or `feat/new-theme`).
3. **Implement Your Changes:** Make sure your code adheres to the style guidelines.
4. **Test Your Changes:** Run the extension locally (see [Testing Your Changes](#testing-your-changes)) to ensure everything works as expected.
5. **Submit a Pull Request:** Include a clear description of your changes and reference any related issues.

## Code Style Guidelines

- **JavaScript:**  
  - Use modern ES6+ syntax.
  - Write clear and concise comments where necessary.
  - Follow consistent naming conventions and code formatting.
  - When modifying files such as `src/content.js`, `src/page_script.js`, or `src/popup.js`, keep in mind that these files interact with Chrome APIs and the DOM. Ensure your changes are well-tested.

- **HTML/CSS:**  
  - Follow semantic HTML practices.
  - Use clear, descriptive class names.
  - Keep styles modular and maintain consistency with the existing design.

- **Commit Messages:**  
  - Write descriptive commit messages that explain the “what” and “why” of your changes.
  - Reference any related issue numbers when applicable.

## Project Structure

Below is a brief overview of the key directories and files:

- **`src/content.js`** – Contains the main logic for handling Vim-like commands and mode indicators.
- **`src/index.html`** – The popup interface for the extension.
- **`src/keybinds.html`** – A reference page listing the keybindings.
- **`src/page_script.js`** – Injected into the active document to simulate key events.
- **`src/popup.js`** – Manages settings from the extension’s popup and communicates with the content script.

Understanding the project structure will help you locate the relevant parts of the code when making changes.

## Testing Your Changes

To test changes locally:

1. **Load the Extension in Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode."
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the root directory of your project.
2. **Try Out the Features:**
   - Open Google Docs and test the Vim-like motions.
   - Use the popup interface to change settings (e.g., themes, debug mode).
3. **Check the Console:**
   - Open the Developer Tools console to view any logs or errors.
